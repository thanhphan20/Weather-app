## Clone My Repo <br>

After Cloning, Go to the directory by typing the command shown below.

```
cd Gym-platform
```

Then install package in each folder

```
cd frontend && npm install
cd backend && npm install
```

After that create `.env` in api folder

```
cp .example.env .env
```

Finally run the app in each folder

```
npm start
```

Or you can use the docker command

```
docker-compose up -d --build
```

Then go directly to the url:

localhost:3000 for the frontend
localhost:3000 for the backend
